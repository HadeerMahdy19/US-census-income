## Dataset information: :abcd:	
The United States Census Bureau (USCB), officially the Bureau of the Census, is a principal agency
of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, responsible for producing data about the American people and
economy. The Census Bureau's primary mission is conducting the U.S. Census every ten years, which
allocates the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives to the states based on their population. The
Bureau's various censuses and surveys help allocate over $675 billion in federal funds every year and
it helps states, local communities, and businesses make informed decisions. The information provided
by the census informs decisions on where to build and maintain schools, hospitals, transportation
infrastructure, and police and fire departments.<br>

## Goal :goal_net:	
Analyze, Clean and Model the data to predict --income-- column using Machine learning<br>

## Output :heavy_check_mark:	
89% accuracy using Random forest<br>

## Future work :eyeglasses:	
1- Further data preprocessing <br>
2- Further analysis of result<br>
3- Use xgboost regressor or other models to improve results
